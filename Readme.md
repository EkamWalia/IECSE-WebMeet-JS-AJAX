## IECSE Web Meet
### Javascript And AJAX

The main topic of this workshop is to introduce attendees to DOM manipulations with Vanilla Javascript. Following a project-based approach, the attendees will learn by building a simple quiz game with HTML/CSS and JS. The quiz game involves presenting the player with mulitple choice questions and checking the palyer's answers to determine their final score.

In the second part of the workshop, the attendees will be introduced to AJAX requests. The project SWAPI involves sending an AJAX request to
[Star Wars API]('https://swapi.co/') to search for a particular Star Wars character and the response is displayed on the HTML page with DOM manipulations learnt in the first part of the workshop.
